# Space-Invaders-JS
A retro Space Invaders Game built in JavaScript

My first iteration of Space Invaders, a retro game where you get sent to deep space with your spaceship. Your mission is to destroy all the aliens. If you fail the game is over. Once you succeed however you WIN.
Inspirtaion is based on Ania Kub√≥w's guide on YouTube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6LrpUTQQn0&ab_channel=CodewithAniaKub%C3%B3w)

The Menu page and Level System are in the works!
